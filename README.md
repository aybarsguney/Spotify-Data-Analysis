Spotify Stream Analysis: Exploring music preferences through seasonal trends and genre analysis.

# Spotify Stream Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes my Spotify stream history from 2019, exploring music preferences through seasonal trends and genre analysis.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from my personal Spotify stream history of 2019. The dataset includes information such as timestamps, track details, popularity scores, and track genres.

## Data Analysis

### Techniques Used
- Data cleaning to handle missing values, empty genres, and popularity scores of 0.
- Seasonal analysis to investigate the distribution of songs and the most common genres in each season.
- Visualizations, including countplots and boxplots, to represent trends.
- Hypothesis testing using a chi-square test to examine if the most common genres change seasonally.

### Different Stages of Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the raw data to ensure its quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigating key trends and patterns in the data.
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Testing the hypothesis about changing music preferences seasonally.

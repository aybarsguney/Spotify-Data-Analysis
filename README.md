Spotify Stream Analysis: Exploring music preferences through seasonal trends and genre analysis.

# Spotify Stream Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes my Spotify stream history from 2019, exploring music preferences through seasonal trends and genre analysis.

## Motivation
This project aims to analyze my Spotify stream history from 2019, uncovering patterns in music preferences and exploring how they change over different seasons.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from my personal Spotify stream history of 2019. The dataset includes information such as timestamps, track details, popularity scores, and track genres.

## Data Analysis

### Techniques Used
- Data cleaning to handle missing values, empty genres, and popularity scores of 0.
- Seasonal analysis to investigate the distribution of songs and the most common genres in each season.
- Visualizations, including countplots and boxplots, to represent trends.
- Hypothesis testing using a chi-square test to examine if the most common genres change seasonally.

### Different Stages of Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the raw data to ensure its quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigating key trends and patterns in the data.
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Testing the hypothesis about changing music preferences seasonally.

## Findings
Through this analysis, I have gained insights into my music preferences, identifying the most common genres and how they vary across different seasons. The project provides a reflection on my musical tastes during the year 2019.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations
- The analysis is based on historical data and may not reflect current music preferences.
- The dataset is limited to the available Spotify stream history and does not include external factors influencing music choices.

### Future Work
- Explore real-time data analysis to understand current music preferences.
- Incorporate additional external data sources to enhance the analysis.
- Extend the analysis to cover more recent years for a comprehensive view of evolving music tastes.

## Files Included
- `spotify_analysis.py`: The main Python script for data analysis.
- `visualizations/`: Folder containing generated visualizations.
- `README.md`: Provides information on the project and how to use it.
